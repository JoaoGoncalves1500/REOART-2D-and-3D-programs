# REOART 2D and 3D programs
The REOART 2D and REOART 3D (Real Environment Ocean-Acoustic Ray Tracing) are two ocean acoustical ray tracing tools based on Fermat’s least time principle in a real environment. These programs use an ocean-acoustic parametric ray tracing propagation models in 2D and 3D, and are they are composed by systems of
algebraic-diﬀerential equations (DAE's). 

The programs use three different databases
